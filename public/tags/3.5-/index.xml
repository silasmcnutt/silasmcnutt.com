      <description>The Fall Guy (2024) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;“I’m on Metalstorm, too!” “Liar! We’re on Metalstorm ONE!”&#xA;I’ll be honest, I’m not sure why I held off on this movie for so long. When it came out it looked fun, but not fun enough for me to go out of my way to watch. When I started looking for movies to watch, I wanted something released this year because I felt like there were a few that I had missed out on.</description>

      <description>Abigail (2024) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;Spoiler-Free Section&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;I had mediocre expectations going into this movie as I think practically every horror movie is overdone and ends up being a bust, but Abigail was a pleasant surprise. This movie is decently well paced, well acted, and has fine shots. The special effects weren’t great by any stretch of the imagination, but that seems to be a common theme in newer movies with tighter deadlines requiring effects artists to rush.</description>
