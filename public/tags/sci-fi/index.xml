      <description>Despicable Me 4 (2024) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;“I tranqued myself!”&#xA;There’s a reason that Minions: Rise of Gru is the highest rated Despicable Me related movie after the original. Everyone loves the minions! To be honest, though, this franchise is getting worn out. I don’t think that there was anything about this movie that made it stand out from the rest. It was silly and fun, but outside of that there really isn’t much to talk about.</description>

      <description>Nemesis (1992) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;Ok, am I missing something, or was this movie just hot garbage? What is there to like about Nemesis? Shitty writing and acting, cheesy costumes and props, outdated effects, and a plot which is just downright boring make this seem like a student film that got the budget of a B-tier film in the 70s. Let’s go one by one.</description>

      <description>The Thing (1982) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;Where do I even begin with this movie? The Thing was fantastic. I had high expectations going in, knowing the reputation this film has built for itself, and it didn’t disappoint. This is a true horror film. It doesn’t rely on cheap jumpscares or poor decision making by the characters. The Thing is something that can be beat, albeit not easily, which makes the ending not nearly as predictable as some other horror films where the antagonist is quite literally immortal.</description>
