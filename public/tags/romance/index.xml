      <description>The Fall Guy (2024) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;“I’m on Metalstorm, too!” “Liar! We’re on Metalstorm ONE!”&#xA;I’ll be honest, I’m not sure why I held off on this movie for so long. When it came out it looked fun, but not fun enough for me to go out of my way to watch.

      <description>On the Rocks (2020) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;While there isn’t much to say about this lovely little flick, it’s nice to have a watch with movies like these every now and then. On The Rocks is a nice little changeup from your run of the mill romance movie, with Laura questioning the legitimacy of her marriage, leading to an all out investigation on her husband.</description>
