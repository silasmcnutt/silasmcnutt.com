      <description>Inside Out 2 (2024) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;I think it’s fair to say that this is one of the better Pixar films in recent history. Inside Out 2 was shockingly good, and I loved every minute of it. The pacing, the animation, the plot, the morals, and everything in between was fantastic. Dare I say that this was better than the first? Seriously though, I came out feeling as if there was so much more to take away than anything the first one had begun to touch on.</description>

      <description>12 Angry Men (1957) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;Quick sidenote: I had writer’s block as I wrote nearly this entire review so apologies in advance. It’s not very good and I certainly don’t do the movie justice.&#xA;Spoiler-Free Section Man, they don’t make movies like they used to. I don’t think I’ve ever come across a film with better writing than 12 Angry Men. The comedic aspects, the dramatic irony, and smart remarks make every piece of dialogue so enjoyable in their own respective ways.</description>

      <description>Robot Dreams (2023) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;My girlfriend and I found this movie by accident when searching for something to watch. Neither of us had heard anything about it, but it quickly drew us in with the cutesy animation and fun feel to it. But boy was I wrong for thinking this would be a happy go lucky type of movie to end the night with.</description>
