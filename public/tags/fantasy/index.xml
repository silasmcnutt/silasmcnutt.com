      <description>Inside Out 2 (2024) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;I think itâ€™s fair to say that this is one of the better Pixar films in recent history. Inside Out 2 was shockingly good, and I loved every minute of it. The pacing, the animation, the plot, the morals, and everything in between was fantastic. Dare I say that this was better than the first? Seriously though, I came out feeling as if there was so much more to take away than anything the first one had begun to touch on.</description>
