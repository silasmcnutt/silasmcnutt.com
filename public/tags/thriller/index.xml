      <description>Righteous Kill (2008) - Link to heading&#xD;Follow me on Letterboxd!&#xD;To be honest, I feel like everyone is a little tough on Righteous Kill. Was the movie great? No. But dropping 0.5 or 1 star ratings on this bad boy like it&amp;rsquo;s Diary of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul is just an outright crime. Look, I get it. Throwing De Niro and Pacino into a film together and it coming out undercooked is something that saddens me as well, but to act like this movie had nothing to take off on is just harsh.</description>

Shitty writing and acting, cheesy costumes and props, outdated effects, and a plot which is just downright boring make this seem like a student film that got the budget of a B-tier film in the 70s. Letâ€™s go one by one.</description>
