It&rsquo;s been a bit since I&rsquo;ve posted on my blog, as you&rsquo;ve probably been able to tell. There&rsquo;s a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, I&rsquo;ve been traveling a bit and haven&rsquo;t had as much time to focus on write-ups for all of the movies I&rsquo;ve been watching. Second, when I have had downtime, I&rsquo;ve been hard at work on a couple of other projects, which I won&rsquo;t get into too much detail about right now.">

        <p>Hey all! üëã</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a bit since I&rsquo;ve posted on my blog, as you&rsquo;ve probably been able to tell. There&rsquo;s a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, I&rsquo;ve been traveling a bit and haven&rsquo;t had as much time to focus on write-ups for all of the movies I&rsquo;ve been watching. Second, when I have had downtime, I&rsquo;ve been hard at work on a couple of other projects, which I won&rsquo;t get into too much detail about right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still been keeping up with some movies, but reviews are time-consuming, and I&rsquo;ve fallen behind in writing them. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love doing these sorts of things, but with other priorities in life, it&rsquo;s been hard to set aside the time or find the desire to put in a half hour or so simply writing. This is why I&rsquo;ve decided to change the way things will be working in the future.</p>
<p>Introducing: <strong>Monthly Movie Montage</strong>! üéâ</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">
  How It Works
  <a class="heading-link" href="#how-it-works">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>With this new and improved system, I will still be able to maintain short blurbs and reviews for all the movies I watch, while also being able to organize my own life along with the clutter of the website.</p>
<p>At the end of each month, I will be releasing a blog post containing short reviews for each movie I watched in the previous month, along with their respective ratings. I will also choose a personal favorite, which will be the &ldquo;winner&rdquo; of that month! üèÜ</p>
<p>I will also list any changes to ratings from the previous month. I find myself looking back at previous movies, comparing them to others I rated a similar caliber, and changing some things around. This system will allow me to feel more comfortable about avoiding recency bias, along with making sure things truly belong where they are.</p>
<p>The final update will be with listing any new movies I added to my watchlist. This will just be a brief summary of anything I found on Letterboxd, recommended to me by a friend, or found elsewhere in the wild. Keep in mind that my watchlist is not entirely indicative of what I plan on watching immediately, but will in theory be watched at some point in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I want to make this system fully functional, well formatted, and easy to expand in the future which is why I&rsquo;m asking for your patience as I look to begin working on figuring out the structure and the overall development. I don&rsquo;t expect it to take long, but there is a chance that I won&rsquo;t finish before this month ends, meaning it could be until the end of September before movie reviews return.</p>

<p>üéÆ <strong>CS2:</strong> With IEM Cologne currently going on, you may see my first blog post regarding CS and some of the takeaways from one of the most prestigious events in all of Esports. You also may not. CS is a topic that I know most of my readers would not be super interested in reading about, but the occasional article may pop up.</p>
<p>üé¢ <strong>Coasters:</strong> I&rsquo;ve had a jam packed summer and would love to share some of my experiences with you all. Keep an eye out for a post documenting my trip to Carowinds.</p>
<p>üîç <strong>Search Feature:</strong> I have looked into implementing a search feature for the website as it was quickly becoming a pain to search manually for a specific movie review, especially as more are added. This feature is still in its testing phase and it could be a bit before it ends up making its way to the main stage. As of right now, its still planned, but it is low priority.</p>
<p>üìù <strong>Other Projects:</strong> I began working on my biggest project a few weeks ago, which actually inspired the offshoot of two more minor &ldquo;projects&rdquo; (quotes necessary, because they are merely simple scripts as opposed to full size projects). These are both entirely functional, but only one has a current release planned, as the other is more personal. Regardless, I know there are a small subset of people out there who may have looked previously for what I&rsquo;ve created, and I&rsquo;d love to share it with them. However, my priorities right now lie in the website.</p>

<p>I know I haven&rsquo;t been active much on here, but quite the opposite is true in my everyday life! There is plenty waiting to be written about and shared with you, just a little bit of patience is required. Things should slow down as I begin my sophomore year of college, giving me a more set in stone schedule to work around. I look forward to posting and hearing any feedback!</p>
<p>Much love, <br>
