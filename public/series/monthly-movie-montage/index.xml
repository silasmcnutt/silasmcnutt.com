      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&#xD;This Month&#39;s Movies&#xD;This month was certainly a bit slower due to the 1.0 release of Satisfactory and most of my time being put toward feeding that addiction, but I still tried to make some time for a few movies this month. Excited to enter spooky season this October, and even more excited to see the movies that come along with it! Which movies are you most excited for?</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&#xD;This Month&#39;s Movies&#xD;This Month&#39;s Movies&#xD;Longlegs (2024)&#xD;Selling your soul to the devil has never been worth it, but Longlegs puts into perspective just how horrible it may be with this psychologically thrilling, anxiety inducing movie. Fantastic acting, solid plot, and some beautiful shots land this a very deserving 8/10.&#xA;8&#xD;/&#xD;10&#xD;La La Land (2016)&#xD;Ok, who the hell put crack in this movie? I genuinely could have never guessed that this romance musical would shoot its way up to the top of my rankings and become one of my all time favorites, even with all of the things I had heard long before watching.</description>
