If it isn’t clear by now, I’m a massive nerd! Outside of tech related stuff I enjoy movies, TV, anime, roller coasters, occasional reading, music, sports, board games, national parks, traveling, spending time with friends and family, and just about anything else you can think of.">

<p>Born and raised in Mason, Ohio, I found a passion for all things tech from a young age. I started playing video games when I was a kid on my family’s Wii and Nintendo DS Lite which would eventually launch me down the rabbit hole of gaming, video editing, electronics, and programming.</p>

<p>I began programming for fun in 9th grade, and decided I wanted to be a CS major in college soon after. I work on a multitude of personal projects for fun and to teach myself how to think like a developer so that I can hopefully end up as a full stack developer! My dream job would be to work in either genetics or the rollercoaster industry using a background in CS, but everything pertaining to programming interests me and would be something I could enjoy.</p>
