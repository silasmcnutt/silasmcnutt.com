Quick sidenote: I had writer’s block as I wrote nearly this entire review so apologies in advance. It’s not very good and I certainly don’t do the movie justice. 

**Spoiler-Free Section**
Man, they don’t make movies like they used to. I don’t think I’ve ever come across a film with better writing than 12 Angry Men. The comedic aspects, the dramatic irony, and smart remarks make every piece of dialogue so enjoyable in their own respective ways. I really miss this old style of writing common during the black and white era. It just feels so… natural.

I think my favorite part of this film besides the writing is how timeless it is. The close mindedness, lack of empathy, and absent critical thinking are all things that are so prevalent in today’s society that it makes 12 Angry Men feel like it was shot in 2024 with a black and white filter thrown over top. I think a lot of the people who fail to appreciate this movie for what it's worth are the exact type of people who don’t understand the value of the message it's putting out.

Besides the writing and timelessness, 12 Angry Men is also just fun. Getting to piece together the murder timeline with the rest of the guys and formulate your own opinion makes it a fun crime movie along with the bold morals it makes clear to those of those who want to listen (ironically enough). 

Despite the murder mystery component, the movie could still feel slow at times, and I found myself wondering how much longer was left despite the fact it was only 90 minutes. I wasn’t doing this because I didn’t enjoy the movie, it just felt like we should have been approaching the end maybe a bit faster than we actually did. I don’t know if the fact that I was watching this right before bed was a contributing factor to this or what, but it did feel somewhat boring for a few minutes on separate occasions.

**Spoiler Section**
The one thing I want to touch on is how well done the ending is. I was a bit worried I’d come out feeling disappointed, and though it was fairly predictable, it was nice to not have any confirmations regarding the suspect’s innocence or guilt. It's almost as if we experienced the case just as the jurors did, eventually choosing to make up our mind without ever knowing whether it was the right decision or not. We will forever be burdened with the curse of obliviousness. And in a way, that’s beautiful. But it’s also terrifying. Which is exactly what got Juror #8 asking all the questions in the first place.
