_“I’m on Metalstorm, too!”
“Liar! We’re on Metalstorm ONE!”_

I’ll be honest, I’m not sure why I held off on this movie for so long. When it came out it looked fun, but not fun enough for me to go out of my way to watch. When I started looking for movies to watch, I wanted something released this year because I felt like there were a few that I had missed out on. Turning on The Fall Guy was a fantastic surprise.

This movie started out _really_ strong. The writing, the irony, the plot, the humor, the acting, and the cheesy effects were really fun. There were a plethora of laughable moments, and it had the perfect balance of being simultaneously super silly while also pulling on your heartstrings a bit.

This didn’t last forever, though. The story quickly evolves, and you’re left with what seems like a distinctly different skeleton than what you began with. Even after sleeping on it, I still can’t decide if this is a good thing. The initial draw may not have been how the story ended, but it’s still fun enough and well done overall.

The entire structure feels like something out of an Angie Tribeca episode. It is both super silly while maintaining somewhat serious undertones to make the plot an actual story. I love when movies are able to do this well because it’s not easy to master, but it's super fun to watch. This movie certainly won’t be one that will go down in history, but it’s a fun watch regardless and definitely worth turning on if you’ve not got a lot to do.
