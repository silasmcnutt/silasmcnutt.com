To be honest, I feel like everyone is a little tough on Righteous Kill. Was the movie great? No. But dropping 0.5 or 1 star ratings on this bad boy like it's Diary of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul is just an outright crime. Look, I get it. Throwing De Niro and Pacino into a film together and it coming out undercooked is something that saddens me as well, but to act like this movie had nothing to take off on is just harsh.

Regardless, I think this movie falls flat in every place where it needed to excel, causing disappointment throughout nearly the entire thing. The twist is predictable and poorly executed, the entire middle section bleeds together, and the ending as a whole is just not good. Now, if you were able to go the entire movie without suspecting the twist, I sense that Righteous Kill would have been a lot more enjoyable. Unfortunately, I think most people saw it coming and weren't surprised in the slightest.

This cast, however, is fantastic. These actors carry the entire movie on their backs and make it bearable. I think the script is fine, and there are certainly some funny moments. The overall plot concept is somewhat interesting too, it just could have been done much better.

I’m getting bored even writing this review because I already don’t care much about the movie anymore, so I’ll just go ahead and wrap this up. If you want to see a mediocre cop thriller, check it out. Otherwise, just watch something else.
