_“I tranqued myself!”_

There’s a reason that Minions: Rise of Gru is the highest rated Despicable Me related movie after the original. Everyone loves the minions! To be honest, though, this franchise is getting worn out. I don’t think that there was anything about this movie that made it stand out from the rest. It was silly and fun, but outside of that there really isn’t much to talk about.

I’ll be honest: before the last 20 minutes or so, this movie was going to be near the bottom of the pile of this year’s movies for me. There was just so much going on. It felt like there were 4-5 different subplots, some of which never even ended up mattering much anyways. And with how many characters these movies are filled with now, it’s hard to feel like there’s any emotional draw one could find with any of the characters.

Anyways, the entire movie is not nearly as streamlined or straight forward as the first one. You can tell the writers had several different ideas of what they wanted to do, and instead of saying no to any of them they just kind of mashed them all together. That being said, I was thoroughly impressed with how well they brought it all together at the end. Not _every_ subplot mattered, but a few of them ended up being somewhat significant to the story, which was something I was not convinced would have been possible.

Outside of the strangely structured plot, everything was extremely average. The writing was fine, the animation was normal, the voice acting was solid, the characters were forgettable, and the jokes sometimes hit. I will say, there felt like times where shots on some of the characters lingered for just half a second or so too long, making for weird pauses in the transition between cuts or scenes. It almost felt Neil Breen-esque (which is the biggest insult a movie can receive).

I don’t think this movie was a waste of my time, and I’m sure it will bring lots of glorious moolah for Universal, but it’s getting old, and I think it’s time for Gru and Co. to retire. That being said, I do love the minions and kind of wish for another movie involving them somehow. Maybe a spinoff with the three girls doing something when they’re older? I’m not sure exactly what that would entail, but the minions always steal the show, and I can’t get enough of those little yellow rascals.
