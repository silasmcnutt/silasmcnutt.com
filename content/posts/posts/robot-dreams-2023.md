My girlfriend and I found this movie by accident when searching for something to watch. Neither of us had heard anything about it, but it quickly drew us in with the cutesy animation and fun feel to it. But boy was I wrong for thinking this would be a happy go lucky type of movie to end the night with. This movie had me all over the place. I was sad at one point, sympathizing with the characters only to then become a victim of emotional whiplash where my hope is restored and a smile is put back on my face. But this cycle continued for practically the entire movie. A relentless throwing around of my emotions as if they mean nothing. Dog and Robot had me in a chokehold the entire time, waiting to see what happened next. 

About halfway through the movie I realized that this movie made me feel the exact same way Marcel the Shell with Shoes On did. The bittersweet moments throughout the entire movie make you confused on where you stand, and scared of how things could end because it's clear the writers can do whatever they want, both with the movie and with your emotions.

Emotional crisis aside, there’s a lot to digest with this movie. Firstly, the animation. It’s so simple, yet so effective. There’s no need for hyper-realistic faces in order to empathize with the characters. Hell, there’s no need for dialogue (which we’ll get to momentarily)! Almost every character in this entire movie looks huggable (yes, even the  anteaters) and it's a joy to see what the animators do with all of the different animals. They manage to strike a perfect balance of leaning into characteristics taken up only by their respective animals while not relying too much on it in order to keep the movie fun and interesting. 

I must admit when I realized Robot Dreams was missing dialogue, I was a little worried. But boy, oh boy do they play their cards perfectly. The writers lean into one of the most important aspects of the entire plot: it doesn’t need dialogue. It’s obviously a risk when studios choose to do this, as it can quickly become boring with no form of dialogue, but I think this plot specifically is so simple, yet so emotional and heartwarming that everything can be expressed through facial expressions or actions, and actually benefits from having no dialogue. This specific concept heavily reminded me of S3E4 of Bojack Horseman (“Fish Out of Water”) where no dialogue takes place, which creates this dichotomy of isolation all while the actual story is about unification. Quite beautiful, right?

I could go on and rave about this movie for endless paragraphs, but I truly feel like this is just something you have to sit down and watch. It’s an emotional rollercoaster, yes, but it's one you’ll be happy you went on by the end of it. Just trust me.
