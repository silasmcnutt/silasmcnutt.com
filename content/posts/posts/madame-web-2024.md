This movie was bad. Like, really bad. It sucks because on paper it seems like it would be average, but somehow the writers managed to completely drop the ball. My biggest problem with the entire thing is the forced dialogue. I don’t think there was a single sentence in this entire movie that I felt seemed natural and human. It almost feels like humans fed an alien AI the English dictionary with all of the example sentences and it came up with this monstrosity. I don’t want to be too harsh because I do really like to actually enjoy movies, but this one I just couldn’t get into.

Besides the dialogue, I was just straight up bored nearly the entire time. The plot is so insanely predictable from within the first 15 minutes and there is absolutely no twist to change the direction. Even for a superhero movie this was below average. Marvel movies recently have at least been somewhat entertaining because of the way they somewhat toy with reality as a whole (virtual illusions in Far From Home, the multiverse concept in No Way Home, etc.), but this movie fell so flat it wasn’t even funny.

Speaking of funny, where is the comedy? Most Marvel movies at least have a few jokes here and there which make them more tolerable for the average viewer, but unless you just love action sequences sooooo much, you’re going to get bored quick. I could see some of the dialogue attempting to be funny, but it just genuinely wasn’t. I feel like an ass saying that since I’m sure some people thought the jokes were okay, but to me, even as someone who loves to laugh, I couldn’t help but cringe.

The last thing I’ll bash this movie for is its awful, awful editing. This CGI was next level poor. It felt like someone shot some of the scenes on TikTok with a couple filters thrown on top. This seems like a common theme with movies recently where editors are on a massive time crunch and forced to meet deadlines that they know will inevitably make their work look horrible. This clearly isn't a fault of the editors and I'm almost positive this movie does not reflect nearly their full potential, but when boss says its time to finish up, you best believe you're making your final touches and sending that thing to the next stage. That's Hollywood in 2024 for ya!

Just about the only thing I actually enjoyed about this movie was the fact that Madame Web wasn’t even really a superhero. Besides being able to see into the future, there’s practically nothing else she does that is supernatural. This is obviously slightly different than your average superhero movie where a bulk of the battle takes place with the protagonist and antagonist throwing cars at each other and the likes, but Madame Web is forced to adapt to find other ways to defeat Ezekiel Sims. Unfortunately, this means using the same exact method in two different fights which are, again, entirely predictable.
