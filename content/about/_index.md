## Hey, I'm Silas!

Born and raised in Mason, Ohio, I found a passion for all things tech from a young age. I started playing video games when I was a kid on my family’s Wii and Nintendo DS Lite which would eventually launch me down the rabbit hole of gaming, video editing, electronics, and programming.

If it isn’t clear by now, I’m a massive nerd! Outside of tech related stuff I enjoy movies, TV, anime, roller coasters, occasional reading, music, sports, board games, national parks, traveling, spending time with friends and family, and just about anything else you can think of.

I began programming for fun in 9th grade, and decided I wanted to be a CS major in college soon after. I work on a multitude of personal projects for fun and to teach myself how to think like a developer so that I can hopefully end up as a full stack developer! My dream job would be to work in either genetics or the rollercoaster industry using a background in CS, but everything pertaining to programming interests me and would be something I could enjoy.
