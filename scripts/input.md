I mean, it’s fine, I guess? I’m struggling to see the 5 star appeal of this one. I think what it attempts to do is done well, and it creates an interesting dialogue, but there’s just too much of this that is either vague or unfinished that it leaves me unsatisfied overall. It probably wasn’t the best idea to write the review for this one nearly a month after watching it, but I guess that my lack of ability to remember exactly what happens speaks to the memorability of the entire film.

Talk about average. I seriously don’t think you could have written a more basic, uninteresting, and boring version of this movie if you tried. Everything about this film comes off as yawn inducing. The characters, the decision making, blah blah blah. Everything is streamlined and predictable, the jumpscares are beyond dull, and the overall plot is B-O-R-I-N-G BORING. Some of the camera shots were fine, I guess, but other than that this was the most traditional horror movie you put on.

I don’t think this movie is awful, but it certainly doesn’t feel original. It feels like a culmination of various movies released in recent years to make a different plot that can only sort of pass as new. On top of this, the “plot twist” revealed near the end is so half-assed and irrelevant that it comes off as more cringey and predictable than shock inducing. Speaking of the end, how did they screw it up so poorly? It’s like they tried so hard to be original, but it just ends up being cheesy and not really making much sense. Regardless, still an entertaining watch and conceptually somewhat fun.

Get Out

For a movie that was predictable throughout almost the entire thing, this film does a fantastic job of both entertaining and creating discussion. You never fully believe that it's over until the credits roll, but it's not done in a cheesy way where the same character keeps coming back after sustaining what should have been life ending injuries on three separate occasions. The cinematography is great, the acting is phenomenal, and Peele overall did a fantastic job on every aspect of this movie. It also offers an interesting commentary on slavery, and, whether intentional or not, shows what it could have become in the 21st century: Not just an enslavement of the body, but of the mind as well. There are subtle hints thrown in all throughout that make it pretty clear the direction things are heading in, but you’re still kept wondering what’s coming next.

Get Out
2017
Jordan Peele does a fantastic job with Get Out making it both entertaining and thought provoking. For a movie that is predictable, it still brings about some shocking moments, and though you're quite confident of something, you're not 100% sure until you witness it happen that its quite where the story is headed. It is captivating from the get-go which is something that I think lots of modern horror movies lack, utilizing suspense as the primary horror delivery device instead. Get Out does a fantastic job of not making its horror come off as cheesy, rarely utilizing jumpscares or shock value. Instead, it takes a disturbing idea that is somewhat realistic and turns it into a reality that the viewer gets to experience. The entire sequence of Chris' hypnosis is beautifully done through the music, visuals, and acting, making the audience feel as if they're the ones being hypnotized along with Chris. I look forward to watching more Peele films, especially if they're all like this.
